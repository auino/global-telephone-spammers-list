# global-telephone-spammers-list

This is a software project including a list of known telephone spammers, compiled by myself, and open for contribution to other parties.

### Details on the list ###

The `list.csv` file includes a list of phone spammers recorded.
For privacy, numbers are not reported on the list. Instead, the md5 result of the full number is reported.

### List format ###

The list is just a simple csv file, with headers, including:
* a short description of the contact
* the md5 result of the full caller's number (including country code, beginning with `+` symbol, without any space or dash line)

### Projects using the list ###

* [auino/virtualphone](https://github.com/auino/virtualphone)

### Contribution ###

The list is open for contribution, in order to extend it with additional spammers.
In case you are interested to contribute, please let me know.
