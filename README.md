# global-telephone-spammers-list

This is a software project including a list of known telephone spammers, compiled by myself, and open for contribution to other parties.

### Details on the list ###

The `list.csv` file includes a list of phone spammers recorded.
For privacy, numbers are not reported on the list. Instead, the md5 result of the full number (including country code, beginning with `+` symbol, without any space or dash line) is reported.
